# ðŸª„ promptify

_Gather your codebase into a single, LLM-ready prompt in seconds!_


**promptify** is a command-line tool that instantly collects any set of files from your project into a single, clearly structured prompt fileâ€”ready for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot.
It is distributed as the Python package **promptify-ai**.

With one command, you can include your entire codebase, or just selected files, with clear headers and zero manual copy-paste. Ideal for code reviews, AI-powered refactoring, or feeding full project context to your favorite AI coding assistant!



## Features

- **Combine your entire project or selected files** using flexible file patterns.
- **Easily exclude files or directories** from the output.
- **Clear file boundaries** thanks to auto-generated headers.
- **Clipboard integration:** result is automatically copied for easy pasting.
- **Fast and lightweight**â€”works with projects of any size.


## Quick Start

```bash

# Collect files from 'myapp/', output to 'llm_context.txt', using custom patterns and excluding a folder
 promptify -s myapp -o llm_context.txt -p '*.md|*.js' -e 'docs'

# See all available options
 promptify -h
```


## How it Works

* Recursively scans the specified directory for files matching your patterns.
* Skips files or directories you choose to exclude.
* Concatenates each fileâ€™s content into a single output file, with a clear header before each file:

  ```
  # ===============================================================
  # FILE: path/to/your/file.ext
  # ===============================================================
  ```
* Automatically copies the result to your clipboard for easy pasting into LLM interfaces.



## Why Use promptify?

* **Save time:** No more copying files one by one for your AI prompts.
* **Boost LLM performance:** Provide your entire context at once.
* **Stay organized:** File headers make navigation easy for you and the LLM.
* **Stay focused:** Exclude unnecessary files and keep prompts concise.
